## Half-Duplex
On a half-duplex channel, only one thing can transmit simultaneously.
These networks require a mechanism for data collision avoidance. ([[CMSA-CD|CSMA/CD]] in the case of Ethernet).

## Full-Duplex
Two nodes can send and receive data to/from each other at the same time. Any host/cable which supports Full-Duplex also supports Half-Duplex.

> [!NOTE]
> To use speeds over 100 Mbit/s, **full-duplex** has to be used.
