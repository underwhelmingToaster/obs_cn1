Fragmentation is a process that occurs in computer networking when a data packet is too large to be transmitted over a network in its entirety.

## IPv4
IPv4 supports fragmenting. The [[Maximum Transmission Unit]] decides if a packet has to be fragmented or not.

#todo maybe more
## IPv6
In IPv6, fragmentation in routers is typically not supported by default, and [[Path MTU Discovery]] is used to avoid the need for fragmentation by determining the optimal packet size for the entire end-to-end path.
