The OSI Model is a layered Model. It consists of seven Layers. 
Layered Models assist in protocol design by preventing technology changes in one layer from affecting the other layers (in theory). 

## The Layers
| Layer | Name | Name of SDU on this Layer |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 7 | [[Application Layer]] |  |
| 6 | [[Presentation Layer]] |  |
| 5 | [[Session Layer]] |  |
| 4 | [[Transport Layer]] | TCP Segment/UDP Datagram |
| 3 | [[Network Layer]] | Packet |
| 2 | [[Data Link Layer]] | (Ethernet) Frame |
| 1 | [[Physical Layer]] | (Physical PDU) |
