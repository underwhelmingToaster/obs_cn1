This layer defines:
- Which cables and plugs are used
- How are signals transmitted (Voltage, Modulation)
- Which encoding is used
[[CMSA-CD]] operates at this level.

## Definitions
### Bit Time
The time it takes to put a but on the wire (or other media). Calculated as:

**Bit time**=1 / NIC Speed in bits/second

### Slot Time
The time it takes for a signal to travel the longest possible distance through an entire network and back to the sender. Depends on transmission speed and size of the network.

## Cables
Nowadays Ethernet mostly runs on twisted Pair or glass fibre cables. In the past, there were other combination. [[Ethernet#Thick Wire Ethernet (Yellow Cable Ethernet, 10Base5, IEEE 802.3)|See here for other cables]]
