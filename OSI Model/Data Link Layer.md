Also known as __Layer 2__, the Data Link Layer consist of two sublayers:
## Logical Link Control Sublayer (LLC) (IEEE 802.2)
- Handles communication between [[Network Layer]] and lower sublayers (typically MAC)
- Adds Control Information to help deliver packets to node #todo explain

## Media Access Control Sublayer (MAC)
- Communicates with the physical [[Physical Layer|Layer 1]] Components
- Handles Data Encapsulation and Media Access Control
### Data Encapsulation
Provides Three Functions:
- Frame Delimiting
- Addressing
- Error Detection
-
