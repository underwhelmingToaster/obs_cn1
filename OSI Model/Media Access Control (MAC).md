Handles Data Encapsulation and Media Access Control:
## Data Encapsulation
Provides three Functions:
__Frame Delimiting__

__Addressing__

__Error Detection__
Each Frame contains a Frame Check Sequence at the End. After a frame has been received, a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is done with the frame content is done and compared to the FCS.

## Media Access Control
This includes
- Initiation of Frame Transmission
- Recovery from transmission failures due to collisions
