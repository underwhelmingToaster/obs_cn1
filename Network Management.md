## Network Management Protocols
### Old School
#### SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

#### MIB

#### Syslog
Used for logging events, sent from devices (clients, routers) to a server. Messages can reach from Debugging Information (Level 7) to Emergency (Level 0)

### New Age
#### Streaming Telemetry
On-Change instead of polled data.

#### SDN (Software Defined Networking)
An approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration to improve network performance and monitoring, in a manner more akin to cloud computing.
